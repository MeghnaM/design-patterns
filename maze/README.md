# maze
Maze game implemented using design patterns. 

The folder simplemazegame contains a basic instance of the maze game, without any design patterns. 

I implemented separate instances of the game for each of the following patterns:
1. Factory Method Pattern
2. Abstract Factory Pattern

The folder playme contains a complete implementation of the maze game, with added functionality that allows a user to undo a command.
